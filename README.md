# Project Description

This project aims to evaluate the implementaion and testing of the inner workings of a bloom filter algorithm. It also evaluates the use of supercomputer capabilities to test insertion and lookup of huge number of elements to the bloom filter.
# Implemenation
We used an object oriented approach to build two custom classess, one which implemented the bloom filter algorithm (BloomFilter), and another which implemented a family of custom hash functions (9 functions) while ensuring there are littile to no correlations for the different has functions, thus reducing the risk of hash function collisions.

Benchamarking was done in two steps:
1: evaluation of the lookup and insertion time of the bloom filter algorithm, which made use of of the implemented function 'benchmark_custom_bloom_filter'. 
2: evalaution of the false positive rate as a function of the number of items added to the bloom filter

# Time complexity
The time complexity of a Bloom filter algorithm is very efficient for both insertion and lookup operations. Specifically, both operations are ùëÇ(ùëò), where k is the number of hash functions used. During insertion, each of the k hash functions is applied to the input element to determine the k positions in the bit array that need to be set to 1. Similarly, during a lookup, the same k hash functions are applied to check the corresponding positions in the bit array. Since k is typically a small constant, the time complexity for these operations is essentially O(1) in practice. However, the exact time depends on the efficiency of the hash functions and the speed of accessing the bit array.
